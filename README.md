Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.
Data Challenge from Kaggle.

Data, genderclassmodel.py, gendermodel.py, and myfirstforest.py were originally provided from kaggle.
The order of the code for learning about the process goes gendermodel > genderclassmodel > myfirstforest.
Gendermodel just uses gender to make a decision about survival, where Genderclassmodel includes price and class as well.
